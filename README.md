# Wednsday_Task 3 


   Topic modeling is a type of statistical model for discovering the abstract "topics" that occur in a collection of texts. It is an unsupervised approach used for finding and observing the bunch of words (called “topics”) in large clusters of texts. Topic models are built around the idea that the semantics of our document are actually being governed by some hidden, or “latent,” variables that we are not observing.

   Sentiment analysis is used in social media monitoring, allowing businesses to gain insights about how customers feel about certain topics, and detect urgent issues in real time before they spiral out of control.

    This  task here is to classify a tweet as a positive or negative tweet sentiment wise and to discover abstract topics from the file cleaned_tweet_data.csv . this will give an immense insight from a raw data.
